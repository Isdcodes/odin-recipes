    <h3>Recipes for Egusi Soup</h3>
    <p><strong> Gabi Odebode</strong> shares her recipe for a Nigerian egusi soup, a dish she learned from her mother-in-law. Egusi soup is commonly prepared with a combination of meat and leafy greens that’s thickened with dried and ground melon seeds, egusi. There are variations all over <strong>Africa</strong> including egusi stew from Odebode’s home country Ghana and Sierra Leone’s sawa sawa. </p>
    <p>Egusi is a protein-rich dried melon seed that can be consumed whole or ground to thicken soups or stews. Chef Gabi emphasizes that the egusi or melon seeds cannot be substituted. The egusi gourd resembles a watermelon but the flesh is white, bitter, and almost inedible but the seeds are what you want anyway. You can find the seeds already ground available at African markets or online.</p>
